Hi, I’m Ragesh 👋

Aspiring **Data Engineer** with strong fundamentals in **Python and SQL**, and prior experience building **full-stack applications**.

I like working close to data   from how it’s generated in applications to how it’s modeled and consumed for analytics.

### 📊 Data Engineering Projects
- GitHub Event Data Pipeline (In Progress)

    -Building a resilient, near real-time ingestion engine for high-volume GitHub event streams.
    
    -Architecture: Stateless "Sliding Window" ingestion (Python) with a Medallion Architecture (PostgreSQL).
    
    -Key Features: Idempotent database design (ON CONFLICT deduplication), Optimistic Batching with Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for error handling, and automated Quality Gates for data integrity.

- **SQL Data Warehouse Project** *(completed)*  
  Built a data warehouse using Medallion architecture and Star Schema with batch processing and analytical queries.
