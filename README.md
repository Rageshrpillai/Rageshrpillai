Hi, I’m Ragesh 👋

Aspiring **Data Engineer** with strong fundamentals in **Python and SQL**, and prior experience building **full-stack applications**.

I like working close to data — from how it’s generated in applications to how it’s modeled and consumed for analytics.

### 📊 Data Engineering Projects
- **Event to Analytics Data Platform** *(currently developing)*  
  Python + SQL pipeline with API ingestion, validation, idempotent loading, OPDB, and Medallion architecture (Bronze / Silver / Gold).

- **SQL Data Warehouse Project** *(completed)*  
  Built a data warehouse using Medallion architecture and Star Schema with batch processing and analytical queries.

- **Mini Projects / Learning**
  - API ingestion with Python
  - CSV → PostgreSQL incremental loads
  - Validation, logging, and retry patterns

### 🧩 Full-Stack Projects
- **AI PC Builder** – Full-stack project combining backend logic and frontend UI
- **Dashboard Application** – Built using **Laravel** (backend) and **React** (frontend)

These projects helped me understand how real application systems produce data.

### 🛠 Tech I Use
Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Pandas, REST APIs, Git  
Laravel, React, JavaScript

### 🎯 Goal
Preparing for **entry-level Data Engineer roles** by building clear, architecture-driven projects with solid fundamentals.
